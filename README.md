# serverTest

This is an experimental package for swift servers!

this is how i imagine writing server side swift with declarative syntax!

All the language are working except there are no server side components yet. (like responding to http or connectiong to a database)

If you like this new syntax please help me build this to reality!

## PR's are welcome!
